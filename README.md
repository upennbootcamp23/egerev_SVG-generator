## Installation

The following packages have to be installed:
1. Node.js
2. Inquirer ver. 8.2.4 - used to accept user input
3. Jest ver. 29.7.0 - used to run test cases 

## Usage

The project is Node.js-based, which means that the Terminal had to be used in order to do the file. When the user inputs the necessary data (the text, the color for the text, the shape, and the color for the shape), the .svg file is printed. However, in order to open it, one has to open it in the browser. There is no way to test it in VS Code itself.

## Credits

While I may have had some help from multiple sources (as listed below), I can assure you that the work provided is my own, original work.

1. After getting some well-needed rest, my colleague Leo helped me out with the project. His help is shown all over the project. 

2. I'm stating the obvious here, but I used the link (https://github.com/ThomasCalle/Thomas-Object-Oriented-Programming-SVG-Logo-Maker) FOR INSPIRATION ONLY. Everything in this project is changed in order for the work to be my own, original. (And yes, I have read about the Arthur episode... although I shouldn't mention it here)

3. When I tried doing the shapes.js file, this error popped up CONSTANTLY: "Must call super constructor in derived class before accessing 'this' or returning from derived constructor". Thankfully, the crew at Stack Overflow helped me out. Their help is shown in the shapes.js file. (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41350931/when-do-i-need-to-call-super-from-a-constructor)

Other than that, I can safely say that the content of this project is my own, original work.

Please refer to the LICENSE in the repo.

## SVG
Because the SVG file is not deployed on GitHub Pages, I am providing the link for an example SVG file.   <<svg width="300" height="200" viewBox="0 0 300 200" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"> <polygon points="150,18 244,182 56,182" class="triangle" style="fill:orange" /> <text x = "150" y = "140" font-size = "40" text-anchor = "middle" fill = "red">WIL</text></svg>![egerev_logo](https://github.com/upennbootcamp23/egerev_SVG-generator/assets/143010411/b89c7baf-9a0f-4688-bbdb-5db0f4649db2)
